# Camel Spotting :camel: :telescope:

### Description

**Camel Spotting** is an integration that connects your [GitHub Projects](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/) updates into
your team's [Slack](https://slack.com/) to keep everyone on the same page. Be
in the know about your kanban board.

### Status

So far, this will be a bare-bones skeleton with most of the code outline
available directly in the `camel_spotting.go` source file (given the project is
a relatively simple scope).

### Wishlist / roadmap

This is a summary of several features that can be built / expanded upon from
the existing code (with as much description possible without becoming verbose).
NOTE: this is a "living list" so I'll add to stuff her periodically; I might
also just move this all over to GitHub Issues.

- [ ] provided as a self/Heroku-hosted service
- [ ] streamline activation/installation
  - [ ] e.g. GitHub sign-in and Slack button
- [ ] configure setting through Slack slash commands (after install)
  - [ ] e.g. message verbosity, board actions, channels, etc.
